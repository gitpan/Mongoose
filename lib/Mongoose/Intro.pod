=head1 NAME

Mongoose::Intro - an introduction

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01_01

=head1 MOTIVATION

This module is an attempt to bring together the full power 
of Moose into one of the hottest new databases out there: MongoDB.

Before using this module you should take a little time to 
read on MongoDB. 

=head1 Why not use KiokuDB?

KiokuDB is an awesome module that maps objects to data
and caters to a wide variety of backends. Currently there's even a
MongoDB backend that may suit your needs. 

So, why use Mongoose instead?

=over 4

=item *

You want your objects to have their own collection. KiokuDB stores all objects in 
a single collection. MongoDB performs best the more collections you have.

=item *

You want to be able to store relations as either embedded documents or
foreign documents. KiokuDB embeds everything. Here you get to choose.

=item *

You want to abstract your data from your class representation. KiokuDB stores
an extra field called __CLASS__ that ties data to its representation. 
It's not a bad decision, it's just a design choice. 

=item *

You don't need to keep a scope. KiokuDB will keep objects in scope for
you, avoiding breakage in relationships. Here nothing is kept in scope.

=item *

You don't plan to use transactions. KiokuDB is transaction ready. 
But MongoDB is not. So, what's the point here?

=item *

You feel adventurous. 

=back

If you don't need any of this, go grab KiokuDB instead.
It's much more configurable, stable and you get the option
to switch backends in the future. 

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

To use this module, you need:

=head2 MongoDB installed somewhere in your network.

Grab a pre-built copy for your OS from
L<here|http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>, or build it
from L<sources|http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Source+Code>.

=head2 The L<MongoDB> Perl driver

	cpan MongoDB
	cpan Mongoose

=head2 Moose classes

	package MyClass;
	use Moose;
	with 'Mongoose::Document';
	has 'yada' => ( is=>'rw', isa=>'Str' );

=head1 FEATURES

Some of Mongoose features:

=over 4

=item *

It's fast. Not as fast as working with MongoDB documents directly though.
But it's way faster than any other ORM and relation-based mapping modules
out there. 

=item *

* It handles most object relationships, circular references included.

=item *

No persistency. It doesn't manage states for your object. If you save
your object twice, it writes twice to the database. In most cases,
this is actually faster than trying to manage states. 

=item *

Primary keys. This is quite a extraneuos concept for objects, and 
it's not mandatory. But it allows you to automatically control 
when new objects translate to new MongoDB documents, or just update
them.  

This is an experimental feature. There are other ways to do this 
anyway with the MongoDB built-in C<_id> primary-key attribute. 

=item *

Schema-less data. MongoDB does not hold a schema. You can create
new attributes for your object and delete old ones at your leasure.

=item *

No data-object binding means that you may reuse collections,
and peruse inheritance to great extent. 

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item *

This is very much *BETA* software. In fact it's almost alpha, except that the
API is so simple it will probably not change, so let's call it "beta". 

=item *

This module intrusively imports singleton based methods into your class. It's 
the price to pay for a simpler user interface and less keystrokes. 

=item *

Object expansion from the database is done using plain bless most of the time.
Which means your attribute triggers, etc. will not be fired during expansion.
There are exceptions to this rule though. 

=item *

After saving or loading objects from the database, your object will have
an extra attribute, C<_id>. This is a unique identifier. The _id value can be overwritten 
if you wish.

=head1 GETTING STARTED

There are only two steps to start using Mongoose:

1) Create at least one class that consumes a L<Mongoose::Document> tole.
2) Connect to a Mongo database.

MongoDB does not require you to previously create a database, a collection
or a document schema for your collection. This is done on the fly for you.

To make your Moose classes "Mongoable", all they need is to consume either
one of two roles: L<Mongoose::Document> or L<Mongoose::EmbeddedDocument>.

=head2 Turning your classes into Mongo Documents

The difference between these roles lies in the way objects
will be later stored and loaded from the DB. 

Read the MongoDB docs if you don't understand the difference. 

=head3 Document

Akin to a row in the relational model. Relationships are stored using
MongoDB's foreign key system. 

=head3 EmbbededDocument

Tells Mongoose to store your class as an embedded document, part of 
a parent document.

This is usually faster than using document-to-document relations. But
it's not meant for object reuse by foreign documents. 

=head2 Methods you get when using the Document roles

Both C<Document> and C<EmbeddedDocument> will import into
your class the following methods:

=head3 save

Saves the current object to the database, inserting the document if needed.

	$person->save;

=head3 delete

Deletes the correspondind document from the database.

	$person->delete;

=head3 find

Wraps MongoDB's find method to return a cursor that expands data into objects.

=head3 query

	my $cursor = Person->query({ age => { '$lt' => 30 } });

=head3 find_one

Finds exactly one document. 

	my $jack = Person->find_one({ first_name => 'Jack' });

=head3 collection

Returns the L<MongoDB::Collection> object supporting this class. It's a way 
to switch quickly back to MongoDB hash documents. 

	Person->find_one({ name=>'thyself' }); # isa Person

	# whereas

	Person->collection->find_one({ name=>'thyself' }); # ref = HASH

=head2 Connecting 

Then connect to a database anywhere before starting to use your classes. 

	use Mongoose;
	Mongoose->db( 'mydb'); # looks for a localhost connection

	# or, for more control:

	Mongoose->db(
		host=>'mongodb://data.server:4000',
		db_name=>'mydb'
	);           

This is done globally here for simplicity sake, 
but a more object oriented notation is also supported.

=head1 Parameterization

Mongoose roles are L<MooseX::Role::Parameterized|role parameterized>
for greater flexibility.

=head2 Collection naming

You can control the collection name for an individual 
class this way:

	package My::Mumbo::Jumbo::Class;
	use Moose;
	with 'Mongoose::Document' => {
		-collection_name => 'mumbo_jumbo'	
	};

=head2 Global collection naming stategy

By default, Mongoose will turn package names into collections
this way:

	Package name          | Collection name
	----------------------+---------------------
	Person                | person
	Humpty::Dumpty        | humpty_dumpty
	HumptyDumpty          | humpty_dumpty
	MyApp::Schema::Jumbo  | myapp_schema_jumbo

You can change this standard anytime, by setting the
C<Mongoose->naming> closure:

	# remove prefix and return
	#  a lower case collection name
	Mongoose->naming( sub{
		my $pkg = shift;
		$pkg =~ s{^MyApp::Schema::}{}g;
		return lc $pkg;
	});
	
=head3 Primary keys

The standard way MongoDB deals with primary keys is by using 
the C<_id> attribute. By default, a L<MongoDB::OID> is assigned
to each object you commit to the database with C<save>. 

Checkout this L<Devel::REPL> example:
	
	$ re.pl
	> use Person;
	> my $hurley = Person->new(name=>'Hurley');                                                                                                                                         
	$Person1 = Person=HASH(0x102099d08);
	> $hurley->dump;                                                                                                                                                                    
	$VAR1 = bless( {
					 'name' => 'Hurley'
				   }, 'Person' );
	> $hurley->save;                                                                                                                                                                    
	4c683525a74100a8df000000                                                                                                                                                            $ $hurley->dump;         
	> $hurley->dump;                                                                                                                                                                    
	$VAR1 = bless( {
					 '_id' => bless( {
									   'value' => '4c683525a74100a8df000000'
									 }, 'MongoDB::OID' ),
					 'name' => 'Hurley'
				   }, 'Person' );

This is pretty standard MongoDB stuff. 

Now, for a more control over your primary key, use 
the role parameter C<-pk>. 

	package BankAccount;
	with 'Mongoose::Document' => {
		-pk    => [qw/ drivers_license /]
	};
	has 'drivers_license' => (is=>'rw', isa=>'Int' );

That way, with every insert or update, the C<drivers_license> field
is checked with the help of the C<upsert> feature of Mongo.
