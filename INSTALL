INSTALL
-------

You now the drill:

	make
	make test
	make install

Or just use CPAN:

	cpan Mongoose

Or the lighter App::Cpanminus

	cpanm Mongoose

Before installing and running tests, make sure you have a
MongoDB instance running.

* Setting an alternate testing database

By default tests are run against a MongoDB instance
on localhost, default port, and DB named '_mongoose_testing'.

To change defaults, set the MONGOOSEDB env variable to a
comma-separated parameter list as expected by Mongoose->db:

	export MONGOOSEDB=host,mongodb://anotherhost:12345,db_name,test_db_name

* Skipping tests altogether

	export MONGOOSE_SKIP=1
